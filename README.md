# CityJSON + RESTful access + streaming



## todo writing
- scope, not consider "extensions": {}, "appearance": {}, "geometry-templates": {} in CityJSON


## todo coding
- add version column, delete datatilel
- put attri_filtering in the end after combining
- plantcover is too bigg  contadictory to streaming
- storing bbox set decimal to 4 (anders it is 9 too big)
